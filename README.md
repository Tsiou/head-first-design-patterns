## Running the code
### :warning: Node(16+) and Typescript dependencies are necessary dependencies.
1. Run npm install at the project root (installs Typescript dependency)
2. Change folders to the project you'd like to run (cd ./name-of-project/) 
3. Run the typescript compiler on the project's main folder, where tsconfig file exists (tsc)
4. Run node on the ./dist/main.js file after compilation.
